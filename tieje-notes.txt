Choose a tooltip from these searches.

The best ones seem to be
https://github.com/react-component/tooltip
and
https://github.com/wwayne/react-tooltip
Between these, I'll try the former first.
I'll study how to implement the simple proxy server  node. After doing Deep Work today.

TypeScript create-react-app may not incorporate custom proxy functionality:

Proxying API requests is only available in create-react-app in vanilla JavaScript
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development
http-proxy-middleware is technically node.js, however express is not technically pure Node so it is cheating a bit.
I'll use the example to get something running for now.
A pure Node implementation might take longer than I'm willing to commit for this test.
The proxy can be specified in package.json, however, I think I'll need to configure the proxy manually to add functionality later.
From what I can tell, from this article...

This simple server is capable of additional functionality. In the form of a plugin? Not really.
